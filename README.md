# Readable project

This project was implemented to accomplish the project 2 from React
course from Udacity (www.udacity.com).

This project is divided in two parts: api-server and front-end.
The both parts need to be installed and run by npm.

To run api-server just execute:
   - cd api-server
   - npm install
   - node server

To run front-end just execute:
   - cd front-end
   - npm install
   - npm start

The projects listed above have their own README.md files.
